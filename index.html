   <div class="grid-item1">“I thoroughly enjoyed listening to Ralph Macchio's history of The Karate Kid through Cobra Kai, and all the iterations between them. Bonus for the author recording the audiobook himself! I have only seen the original movie and several episodes of Cobra Kai but now I am motivated to go back and watch not only the original movie, but all the sequels and all seasons of Cobra Kai. His enthusiasm for the franchise and his deep affection for his fellow actors, production team, as well as fans involved in all things Karate Kid really shines through in this book.”</div>
